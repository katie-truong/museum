                Coinciding with the opening of Bruce Nauman’s (MFA ’66, UC
                Davis) retro&shy;spective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York,
                this exhibition features the first re&shy;alization of a
                participatory environ&shy;ment Nauman conceived in 1970. The
                work is a narrow passageway that wraps around

              Few living artists have done as much to expand the boundaries of
              art since 1960 as Bruce Nauman. During the mid-late 1960s -
              beginning with his time as a graduate student in the UC Davis
              studio art program, where he received his MA in 1966 - Nauman was
              at the forefront of a generation of artists that placed process
              and activity over static, predetermined forms, and that took up
              language and the body as materials. Unbound by tradition&shy;al
              divisions of medium, Nauman has moved freely between sculpture,
              perfor&shy;mance, film, video, photography, draw&shy;ing,
              printmaking, and large-scale installa&shy;tion.

              This exhibition coincides with a major Nauman retrospective,
              co-organized by The Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) and the Schaulager
              Basel, the artist's first in over twenty years. While the
              retro&shy;spective provides an opportunity to survey the full
              breadth of Nauman's work, the present exhibition at the Manetti
              Shrem Museum focuses on a single, exceptional artwork: a
              large-scale participatory environment from 1970-71. Between 1969
              and 1976, Nauman designed some forty corridors, rooms, and other
              architectural installations. The majority of these installations
              have been built for exhibition on at least one occasion, but Blue
              and Yellow Corridor is one of a handful that have remained on
              paper, in the form of drawings by the artist. Although Nauman
              originally developed the concept for this particular work in three
              drawings of 1970-1971, this exhibition represents the first time
              that the installation has actually been realized. <br />
